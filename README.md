# Stardew Valley Crops Profit Calculator

React and TypeScript data visualization project that renders a bar chart of crop sell values from the farming simulator game Stardew Valley.

The user can input values corresponding to in-game stats to update how the bar chart renders the sell prices of the crops. Using an averaging equation based on the in-game selling price mechanics, the user can input player farming level, fertilizer choices, and amount of days given for the crop to grow to figure out what the most profitable crop to plant would be.

The chart also allows the switching of seasons to test which crop in which season would be best.
